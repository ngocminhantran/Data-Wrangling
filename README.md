## Project Description
There are 2 datasets:
-   prices.csv: records of product's history price changes in Sep 2018
-   sales.csv: records of product's sales in Sep 2018

Use data wrangling tools to calculate the total revenue of each product at each price. The solution must be applicable to similar datasets with large numbers of records.
